This extension and further extensions like:
    * if_yaml_autoparser
    * if_yaml_jetts (not available until now)
    * if_yaml_templavoila
are only "Loader" Extensions, they have the task to build up the specific necessary environment. 
This is done by „extension dependencies and –conflicts“.
They have no own code and can be uninstalled immediately after loading.
